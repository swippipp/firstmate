# without naming the captain order it hangs from and the product goal it serves;
# the acceptance points, the verbatim no-gos, and the embedded rules land in the
# brief as machine-readable blocks; the no-go cap from regeln/VERFASSUNG.yaml is
# enforced hard rather than trimmed silently; and the secondmate charter carries
# the reversed initiative doctrine (the old "You do not generate your own work"
# ban is struck - regeln/ABGESCHAFFT.md, charter-eigeninitiative-verbot).
#
# The rule block is deliberately fail-open: bin/fm-regeln needs a venv, an
# embedding model, and an ingested index, none of which a test fixture has. The
# brief must still be written, with the gap visible as a comment line.
