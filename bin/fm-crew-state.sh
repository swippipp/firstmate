# fm-crew-state.sh - deterministic read of a crew's CURRENT state.
#
# Why this exists: state/<id>.status is an append-only, best-effort EVENT LOG.
# Crews append only wake-worthy transitions (done/needs-decision/blocked/paused/failed)
# and nothing when they silently resume, so `tail -1` of that log reports the
# last EVENT, not the current STATE. After firstmate resolves a needs-decision
# or blocked and the crew resumes (responds to the gate, the pipeline fixes, it
# re-validates), the log's last line stays stale. This helper never infers the
# current state from a tail of the log: it reads the authoritative source (a
# no-mistakes run-step attributed to this crew's branch and current code
# identity, else the pane busy-signature) and reconciles the possibly-stale log
# against it.
#
# The determinism lives entirely here - only run-step / pane / log reads plus
# fixed mapping logic, no heuristics and no LLM. Output is one stable, parseable,
# token-tight line firstmate can read every heartbeat:
#
#   state: <working|parked|done|blocked|paused|failed|unknown> · source: <run-step|pane|status-log|remote-endpoint|none> · <detail>
#
# Logic, in order:
#   1. Resolve worktree + backend target + kind from state/<id>.meta. A meta
#      recording remote_host= is a remote secondmate: its worktree and endpoint
#      live on that host, so the local worktree and pane reads are skipped and
#      the remote host is asked for the endpoint's recovery-grade state
#      (fm-on.sh + fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh state). alive falls through
#      to the routed status log; dead/missing report the remote verdict; an
#      unreachable or unreadable remote reports unknown-remote, never a false
#      gone/dead.
#   1b. An ACTIVE declared machine wait (state/<id>.wait, bin/fm-wait-lib.sh)
#      reports paused · wait-field with the declared reason, deadline, and
#      declaration age, and deliberately outranks the run-step and pane reads
#      below: the old precedence of run-step/pane busy-ness over the worker's
#      own declaration is abolished (plan v3 U1.4). Expired or malformed
#      fields decide nothing.
#   2. Matching no-mistakes run for this crew's branch AND current code identity,
#      active or terminal (from `axi status`, or the coarse `no-mistakes runs`
#      fallback)? For a TERMINAL run, branch name alone is not enough: a
#      historical run on a reused branch whose head was rewritten or diverged
#      must not be attributed. Such a run matches when its head equals the
#      worktree HEAD, or the worktree HEAD is an ancestor of the run head
#      (pipeline fix commits advanced the run on the same line of history).
#      Local work that advanced past the run head, or diverged from it,
#      invalidates attribution. An EXECUTING run on this crew's branch is
#      attributed with no head condition, because a run the pipeline is running
#      right now cannot be history, and it also outranks any older terminal run
#      for the branch - a cancelled or failed run that a newer running one
#      replaced is never the current state (see nm_runs_status_for_branch for
#      the evidence). A run parked at a gate is waiting, not executing, and
#      still needs its head to bind.
#      The run-step is AUTHORITATIVE: running/fixing -> working, ci -> working,
#      awaiting_approval/fix_review -> parked (with gate findings), terminal
#      passed/checks-passed -> done, failed/cancelled -> failed. EXCEPT: while
#      the active step is ci, `axi status` alone cannot tell "still waiting on
#      checks" from "checks green, waiting on merge" (see nm_ci_checks_state) -
#      a ci-step log-tail check overrides working -> done once checks read
#      green, so a green PR is never silently read as still-validating.
#   3. Reconcile the status log: if its last line says needs-decision/blocked but
#      the run-step shows the run moved on, the log is deterministically stale and
#      is flagged superseded. A genuinely parked run plus a needs-decision log
#      agree, and are reported as parked.
#      For harness=claude, a pane parked on Claude Code's account/usage-limit
#      banner (claude_limit_scan below, over bin/fm-busy-lib.sh's
#      fm_busy_claude_limit_banner) never overrides an attributed run's own
#      state: a parked or actively running/fixing/ci run keeps its state and
#      gate detail and only gains an appended `worker pane limit-blocked` note,
#      and a terminal done/failed run is left alone. The pane's paused verdict
#      applies only when no run is attributed (case 4 below) or the attributed
#      run is in none of those states.
#   4. No run for this crew (pre-validation, or kind=scout): first the
#      process-evidence liveness read (fm_backend_agent_state) - an endpoint
#      that is open but confidently agent-free reports unknown · agent-gone
#      with wording that separates process death from window loss (L104,
#      26.08.: "dead" and "missing" used to report word-identically, so the
#      supervisor could not tell an empty shell from a missing window;
#      state/source tokens stay identical, so no token reader breaks) - then
#      the recorded backend's pane busy state, then the status log's last line only
#      when its verb maps to a recognized run-state. Decision-only events such as
#      `resolved` never become current state or detail. For harness=claude, a
#      busy pane verdict is overridden when the pane's composer region shows
#      Claude Code's blocking account/usage-limit widget (see bin/fm-busy-
#      lib.sh's fm_busy_claude_limit_banner for the verified wordings, the
#      anchoring, the widget-to-state mapping, and why a bare limit notice is
#      deliberately NOT a pause): the worker is stalled, not taking a working
#      turn, even though its UserPromptSubmit hook already opened one. A widget
#      that resolves itself reports paused; Claude Code's give-up widget, which
#      never resumes without a human, reports blocked. A bare notice instead
#      annotates the working detail with `limit notice visible in pane`.
#   5. Missing meta or torn-down worktree: report unknown · none. If no run is
#      attributed to this crew, a dead endpoint also reports unknown · none rather
#      than trusting a stale status log.
#
# Read-only towards the crew, its worktree and its pipeline: nothing here can
# start, resume, answer or abort a run. The one write is the bounded negative
# cache state/.run-superseded-<id> described at nm_supersession_absent_cached.
# Always exits 0 on a successful read regardless of state; exit 2 only on a
# usage error (no id).

# This fallback used to shell out to `no-mistakes axi` (bare, no subcommand)
# expecting a `runs[N]{id,branch,status,...}:` TOON table and re-query the

# there is no runs-listing subcommand under `axi` at all, so that table never
# appears and the lookup was silently dead code; whenever the bare `axi
# status` answer was not this crew's own branch, attribution always failed and
# the caller fell straight through to the pane/log fallback below. (The
# PRIMARY cause of the 2026-07 herdr false-surface incidents turned out to be
# a separate precedence bug in bin/fm-watch.sh's since-removed stale path -
# see that file's history - but this cross-branch path was independently
# confirmed dead code and is worth having actually work.)

# The real run-listing command is the top-level `no-mistakes runs` (verified:
# `no-mistakes --help` lists it separately from `axi`; both halves of this split
# re-confirmed on v1.48.0, 2026-08-16). It is plain, human-
# oriented text - no run id, no JSON/TOON, newest-first, columns
# "<status> <branch> <short-sha> <date> [<pr-url>]" separated by runs of
# spaces (verified: no quoting, so splitting on the first two whitespace runs
# is exact) - but branch + coarse status is exactly what this predicate needs:
# is a run for THIS branch active right now. Echoes the matched row's status
# word (running/completed/cancelled/failed), or empty when the branch has no
# usable run within FM_CREW_STATE_RUNS_LIMIT rows.
#
# Rows are newest-first, and the precedence among them is ONE rule, stated here
# and nowhere else. A still-running row wins if and only if the branch's NEWEST
# row is itself running, and such a row needs no head match. Otherwise the answer
# is the first row that binds to this worktree, by its own status word. Otherwise
# the answer is empty.
#
# Why a running newest row needs no head match: the head rule exists to stop a
# HISTORICAL run on a reused branch from being attributed, and a run that is
# still executing cannot be history. A pipeline that rebased or rewrote its head
# (what `no-mistakes rerun` from a preserved head does) is exactly the case that
# must still be attributed to the crew whose branch it holds. A terminal or
# parked row still has to bind, exactly as before.
#
# Why the newest row decides: without running-wins, a crew whose cancelled or
# failed run was immediately replaced by a fresh one kept reporting the dead run
# as its current state (2026-08-16: snacksuite run 01M03RWN cancelled and
# replaced by 01M0492M running still read as "failed: run cancelled"; lensclash
# run 01M0490J failed and replaced by 01M04KJJ still read as "failed: run
# failed" while `axi status` showed running/fixing), and the watcher turned that
# into an inactive-crew false alarm. In both cases the branch's newest row IS the
# running replacement. Without the newest-row condition, an OLDER row left stuck
# at running would suppress a newer real terminal verdict, and a genuinely dead
# crew would read as working forever.
#
# Accepted residual risk: a row stuck at running at the TOP of the list is still
# read as working. The counterweight is the wedge-escalation progress probe
# (crew_run_progressed in bin/fm-classify-lib.sh), which goes through `axi
# status` and absorbs only on actual movement.
#
# Exit status separates "the listing answered" (0) from "the listing produced
# nothing at all" (1), because nm_run is fail-open: a timed-out or erroring CLI
# is indistinguishable from a clean answer by the printed word alone. Callers
# that only need the word can keep ignoring the status - an unanswered listing
# prints nothing either way - but a caller that would REMEMBER the answer must
# not remember a non-answer.
