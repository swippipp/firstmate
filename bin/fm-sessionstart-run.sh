#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Session-open entry point for harnesses that RUN the digest instead of asking
# the agent to. It is the one command those harnesses' session-open adapters
# invoke, and it decides, from the session-open source, whether this open needs
# the full digest, a context re-emit, or nothing at all.
#
# Why running beats nudging: bin/fm-sessionstart-nudge.sh can only ASK the agent
# to take the helm, and an agent can defer that, including when a first-command
# skill has its own read-only path. When the harness injects hook stdout into
# model context, running the digest here removes that discretion - the helm is
# taken before the model's first turn, whatever the first turn is.
#
# Usage: fm-sessionstart-run.sh [--source <source>]
#   --source  The harness's own session-open source. When omitted, the source is
#             read from a Claude/Codex-shaped JSON hook payload on stdin
#             (the `source` field). An unreadable or unrecognized source is
#             treated as `startup`, because taking the helm redundantly is
#             cheap and idempotent while not taking it is the whole bug.
#
# Source routing (see docs/sessionstart-nudge.md for the per-harness names):
#   startup, new            full digest - this process has not taken the helm
#   clear, compact          `--reemit` digest only when this lock owner recorded
#                           a completed full startup; otherwise a full digest,
#                           so a startup killed mid-sweep is finished first
#   resume, reload, fork    delegate to the nudge wrapper. Prior context is
#                           restored on these, so re-running is redundant when
#                           this process still holds the lock (the nudge stays
#                           silent) and a plain instruction is enough when a new
#                           process resumed an old session (the nudge fires).
#
# Every path exits 0, exactly like the nudge wrapper: a Claude SessionStart
# exit 2 blocks session initialization, so a failed session start must reach the
# agent as digest text it can act on, never as a refusal to open the session.
# A lock another live session holds and a truncated digest are reported inside
# the digest, while broken GitHub auth arrives through the deferred network
# result inline or as a wake, for exactly that reason.
