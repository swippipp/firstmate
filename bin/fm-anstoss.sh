# fm-anstoss.sh - the Anstoss-Automat: detect lanes that silently exited and
# nudge them up a two-step ladder, so a restart order does not always have to
# come from the captain (order anstoss-automatik, 2026-08-24; O-0023 incident:
# four of six fresh Ox lanes of one wave stood silently while their status
# lines kept claiming working).
#
# Detection is STATE AT THE ENDPOINT, never stillness-over-time (window-
# stillness alarms are abolished, Flottenordnung L28). One sweep iterates ONLY
# this home's own state/*.meta records (L86) and classifies each ordinary
# ship/scout lane. A lane stands silently exited when ALL of:
#   1. its backlog post is in_flight,
#   2. its recorded endpoint holds a verified live agent,
#   3. its pane carries NO known harness working marker anywhere in the FULL
#      visible capture (the whole capture-pane surface is read, never a tail -
#      an API-error banner often renders far above the prompt and a short tail
#      was blind for 2 of 3 standing windows on 2026-08-24),
#   4. its status file ends on no terminal verb (done/failed/blocked, plus
#      needs-decision: that post waits on firstmate by design, not on a nudge),
#   5. no working child processes: no CPU delta across the sweep interval and
#      no advancing no-mistakes run - a lane correctly waiting on real CI or a
#      declared pipeline counts as WORKING and is never nudged,
#   6. no active machine wait field (bin/fm-wait-lib.sh).
# fm-crew-state's aggregate working verdict is deliberately NOT consulted: on
# 2026-08-24 it said working for three standing lanes, so only endpoint-owned
# signals feed this classifier.
#
# Working markers come from the verified adapter knowledge (.agents/skills/
# harness-adapters/SKILL.md), never guessed: claude/claude-ox render
# "esc to interrupt", grok renders "Ctrl+c:cancel", cursor renders the token
# "ctrl+c to stop". Harnesses with no verified rendered marker (codex, kimi,
# muse, opencode, pi) simply contribute no pane signal here - condition 3
# passes vacuously for them and conditions 5/6 carry the liveness verdict.
#
# Failure-class separation (O-0018): a standing pane whose capture matches an
# API-error signature ("API Error", cloudflare) runs its OWN two-nudge ladder
# instead of being silently folded into the standing-lane ladder above
# (captain's word, 25.08. mittags: "geht das nicht per waechter? Arbeiter
# scannen und wenn die letzte ausgabe API-Error enthaellt einfach 'weiter
# gehts' schreiben?!?" - EN: "can't the watcher do this? Scan workers and if
# the last output contains API-Error just type 'keep going'?!?"). The
# signature list lives in api_error_matches() below and owns that vocabulary.
# The one exception: a pane whose capture ALSO shows an open interactive
# choice (a numbered "N. Yes" menu, vocabulary owned by dialog_choice_pending()
# below) is never typed into - reported once per distinct image instead,
# exactly the pre-automation path, because a freeform nudge line typed into a
# live selection is a fresh mistake, not a recovery.
#
# Ladder per lane, counted in state/.anstoss-count-<id>:
#   Stage 1 (automatic, silent): one fm-send nudge carrying a written end
#     condition - verify what is committed at the artifact, answer the open
#     acceptance points, then report done: with evidence, or blocked:/paused:
#     with a reason, or declare a machine wait field. Minimum spacing between
#     nudges is FM_ANSTOSS_INTERVAL seconds.
#   Stage 2 (from the SECOND ineffective nudge): when the situation fingerprint
#     (status tail plus full capture) is UNCHANGED after the spacing interval,
#     print one line waking firstmate with the lane id and counter - a relaunch
#     stays firstmate's decision.
#   Refuted nudge (L34): a lane that turns out working after being nudged
#     doubles that lane's minimum spacing (capped doublings), so a false alarm
#     makes the Automat quieter, never louder. A lane closing with a terminal
#     verb resets everything.
#
# Work without an order (Flottenordnung v2, L98) is a THIRD, separate class,
# owned by bin/fm-anstoss-auftrag-lib.sh: a live lane that cannot name a
# commissioned post is not stuck, it is unaccounted for, so it is reported to
# firstmate and NEVER nudged. That library's header owns what counts as a post
# reference, the Bestand transition rule, the arming flag, and its own report
# ladder (state/.anstoss-auftrag-<id>, state/.anstoss-auftragzeit-<id>); this
# script only hooks it in per lane, logs its verdicts into the check log below,
# and feeds its backlog reading into condition 1 and the stage-2 fingerprint.
# A lane with an ACTIVE machine wait field keeps being silenced entirely,
# including for this class: it made a statement about what it waits for, and the
# missing order surfaces on the sweep after that wait expires.
#
# O-0018 ladder per lane, counted in state/.anstoss-o18n-<id> (separate from
# the standing-lane counter above; a lane classifies as EITHER standing OR
# O-0018 on a given sweep, never both):
#   Nudges 1 and 2 (automatic, silent): the same fm-send path types a fixed
#     API-recovery line - resume the work, measure the worktree instead of
#     recalling it, close on a terminal status line. Spacing is the same
#     FM_ANSTOSS_INTERVAL/backoff clock the standing ladder uses (shared per
#     lane, so a refutation on this lane quiets both ladders together).
#   From the third API failure (i.e. the second nudge proved ineffective): no
#     further auto-nudge - one line wakes firstmate instead, repeating every
#     spacing interval while the lane stays stuck (account re-routing stays
#     supervisor business, O-0018).
#   Refuted nudge and terminal close: identical L34/reset handling to the
#     standing ladder, through the same shared note_liveness_recovery() path.
#
# Every sweep prints NOTHING to STDOUT unless firstmate must act: exactly one
# line for a standing-lane stage-2 escalation, an O-0018 escalation, a
# dialog-blocked O-0018 first sighting, or a work-without-an-order report.
# Fleet stop (state/.fleet-stop) silences all nudges and reports (U0.1).
#
# Check observability (O-0041 root cause, captain's word 25.08.: he nudged
# worker 6 past an API error BY HAND because it was undecidable whether past
# sweeps had even seen the pane - green selftests prove nothing against the
# live case without a record of it, L03): every sweep APPENDS one line per
# suspicious pane to its own log, state/.anstoss-check.log - NOT the
# revival-era .fm-anstoss.log, which belongs to a different function. A pane
# is suspicious when its capture carries an API-error signature (whatever the
# outcome: nudge typed, spaced out with reason, escalated, dialog reported,
# or silenced by the harness working marker) or when it classifies as a
# standing lane, and whenever the work-without-an-order class reports or first
# inventories a Bestand lane. Each line carries: timestamp, lane id, matched
# signature, busy/idle verdict, O-0018 counter as of AFTER the action, and the
# action (stufe1-getippt / stufe2-getippt / eskaliert / erstbefund-gemeldet /
# gemeldet / inventur / uebersprungen with reason). Gate decisions of the
# work-without-an-order class additionally appear as JSONL in
# state/tor-log/arbeit-ohne-auftrag.jsonl (that library's header owns the
# contract). Healthy panes log nothing, so volume is bounded
# by stuck lanes x sweep rounds and shrinks with every recovery; an ignored
# stuck lane keeps waking firstmate long before unbounded history could
# accumulate, so this log needs no rotation.
#
# Latency decision (brief item 3; numbers measured 25.08., sources in bin/):
# detection is bound by fm-watch's shared check cadence - CHECK_INTERVAL=300s
# default plus at most POLL=15s loop jitter - because nudge-on-detect already
# fires on the FIRST sighting of an error pane. Anything below that cadence is
# unreachable from this script alone; lowering CHECK_INTERVAL would speed up
# all dozen registered checks at once and stays firstmate's call. The binding
# gap was the SHARED nudge spacing instead: FM_ANSTOSS_INTERVAL=600s gated the
# O-0018 ladder too, putting worst-case onset-to-escalation at roughly 25-35
# minutes (derived: ~315s detect + two sweep-gated spacings of 600..900s each).
# The O-0018 auto-nudges therefore run their OWN spacing,
# FM_ANSTOSS_O18_NUDGE_INTERVAL=120s (still L34-doubled): below the 300s sweep
# floor the sweep itself is the clock, so nudge #2 lands on the very next
# round; any value in (0,300] behaves identically at live cadence and 120
# keeps a real floor for manual or faster sweeps. Escalation repeats stay on
# the shared 600s/L34 clock, so firstmate's wake volume is unchanged and the
# only added machine work is one earlier send-keys per stuck lane.
#
# FM_ANSTOSS_DEBUG=1 prints a stderr decision trace (counter, clock, gate) for
# every ladder pass - forensics for exactly the undecidable cases the check
# log exists to prevent; it stays off by default and writes nowhere else.
