#                        [account=<speicher>] [brief=<pfad>] [subject=<text>]
#       -> 0 free, 1 blocked (the refusal is already printed, loud, with the
#          source it comes from and the way out).
#
# WHY. Every rollback of 24.-25.08. had the rule in place and no READER at the
# point of action: fm-spawn read only state/.fleet-stop, so a pinned captain
# order (O-0083, account seat), a live reservation, an open captain remark, and
# a ship brief with no acceptance block all passed unseen, and the account came
# from whatever CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR the invoking session happened to carry. This
# file is that missing reader: it asks the four existing gates in a fixed order
# and refuses at the FIRST one that holds, and it resolves the account from the
# ledger instead of inheriting it.
#
# Gate chain (fixed order, first block wins):
#   (a) order      - fm_order_gate_check (bin/fm-order-gate-lib.sh)
#   (b) reservation- fm_reservierung_check (bin/fm-reservierung-lib.sh)
#   (c) remark     - fm_brett_vollzug_check (bin/fm-brett-vollzug.sh)
#   (d) acceptance - bin/fm-abnahme.sh check-brief (ship spawns only)
#
# Arming (this header is the single owner of the two flags it names):
#   state/.tor-order-scharf         arms (a). Missing = silent passage.
#   state/.tor-reservierung-scharf  arms (b). Missing = silent passage.
#   (c) and (d) are gate SCRIPTS that own and check their own flags
#   (state/.tor-bemerkung-scharf, state/.tor-abnahme-scharf); this file never
#   double-flags them - it only asks, and prints what they answer.
# An unarmed sub-gate is not asked at all, so it writes no Tor-Log line either:
# "built but standing down" must stay distinguishable from "looked and passed".
#
# Loudness (L33/L14): a sub-gate that cannot READ its own source (unreadable
# order book, unreadable reservation) is a refusal, not a pass - a gate never
# guesses what the captain meant. A missing gate script is the one exception:
# it is an unbuilt gate, warned about once and passed, because failing closed on
# a tool that was never installed would stop the fleet over nothing.
#
# Account contract (AGENTS.md "Accounts and day close": the account is a managed
# state, never inherited):
#   - claude:    role offiziere-worker from config/konten.tsv (every spawn this
#                tool makes is a worker or an officer; the firstmate seat is
#                moved by bin/fm-sitzwechsel.sh, never by a spawn). The resolved
#                storage path becomes the launch's CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR prefix.
#   - claude-ox: its launch template pins the wrapper `claude1`, which exports
#                its own store; the storage is resolved BACK from that wrapper
#                name through the ledger, so the account is still recorded and
#                still gate-checkable, and no prefix is added.
#   - anything else (codex, pi, grok, ...): no Anthropic account, "-".
#   - --konto <speicher> overrides the role lookup for claude, and for claude-ox
#     it must name the storage its wrapper already pins (anything else would
#     record an account the launch does not use).
#   - a missing config/konten.tsv is a LOUD abort - never a silent fall back to
#     the inherited CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, which is exactly the drift that put a
#     worker on the firstmate seat.
#   - before the launch, fm_konto_startfaehig decides whether a session can
#     really start on that seat; a seat that would drop the agent into the
#     onboarding wizard fails LOUD here with the instruction, instead of hanging
#     silently in a pane nobody watches.
#
# This file is a LIBRARY: it only ever returns, never exits, so a caller under
# `set -e` takes every verdict as a return value (`if ! fm_spawn_gates_check ...`).
